# LinioChallenge

**The requirements of the challenge do not describe the use of frameworks, attached libraries or external APIs, so the way to solve it was the simplest, fastest and easiest to me. But it would comply with the requirements.**

program description:

Challenge - Backend Developer
Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for
multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Linio". For multiples of 5 print
"IT". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "Linianos".
But here's the catch: you can use only one `if`. No multiple branches, ternary
operators or `else`.

Requirements
-1 if
-You can't use `else`, `else if` or ternary
-Unit tests
-Feel free to apply your SOLID knowledge
-You can write the challenge in any language you want. Here at Linio we are big fans of PHP, Kotlin and TypeScript 

#Requirements to run
PHP 5.6 or superior
